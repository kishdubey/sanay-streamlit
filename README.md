# Streamlit Sanay
Simple web app to play around with the Keras LSTM model trained to classify the sentiment of a given text. The model was trained on the [sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset. Makes sure to checkout Sanay, the chat application providing social cues for those that find it difficult through sentiment analysis, [here](https://github.com/kishdubey/sentichat).
